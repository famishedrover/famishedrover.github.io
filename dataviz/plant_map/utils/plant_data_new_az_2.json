Leaves: Alternate and sessile; blades linear to lanceolate, 2-6 cm long, with a midvein that is prominent beneath and indented above; leaf surface covered with long, appressed hairs; longest leaves are midway up the stem, with basal leaves reduced to scales and upper leaves reduced to bracts near the inflorescences. Flowers: Yellow to orange and trumpet-shaped, in short-pedicelled racemes near branch tips; calyx 5-lobed, 4-6 mm long; corolla yellow or orange-yellow, funnelform with 5 lobes, the tube 8-13 mm, strigose on the outside, and the lobes short and rounded, 2 mm long; flowers heterostylous. Fruits: Nutlets 3 mm long, white and shining; often only one per calyx matures. Ecology: Found on gravelly and litter covered soils, in sagebrush flats, pinyon-juniper woodlands, pine woodlands and forests, and aspen communities, from 6,000-9,500 ft (1829-2896 m); flowers May-September. Distribution: CO and UT south to TX, NM, and AZ; south to MEX Notes: This species is distinguished from other Lithospermum spp. by its corollas, which are hairy on the outside, small, and narrow, with the lobes each about 2 mm long (L. cobrense has short, wide, funnel-shaped corollas, about as wide as they are long and hairy on the inside, and L. incisum has corollas much longer than they are wide, with tubes appearing elongate, 1-3 cm long, also hairy on the outside); and the lack of leaves near the base of the stems (L. cobrense has an obvious basal rosette of leaves which mostly persists into flowering, and L. incisum has leaves down to the base of the stems though not always forming a distinct rosette). All 3 species show purple stains on herbarium sheets, though the formal description for L. cobrense claims its roots and crowns lack dye. Ethnobotany: The root was used ceremonially, and the seeds were used as food. Etymology: Lithospermum comes from the Greek lithos, \"stone,\" and sperma, \"seed,\" while multiflorum means many-flowered. Editor: LCrumbacher, 2011, AHazelton 2017 ",

Distribution: AZ, CO, KS, NM, OK, TX, UT; south to MEX Notes: Lorandersonia is a Chrysothamnus segregate and could easily be mistaken for a member of that genus. This species is distinguished by due to the lack of glands on the leaves and stems; the small, mostly flat leaves only a couple cm long and up to 3 mm wide; the single purple vein visible on the underside of each leaf; the 1 cm long pappus of bristles attached too each seed; and the shrub's relatively short stature, under 1 m tall.   Lorandersonia baileyi\u00a0is often treated as a subspecies of\u00a0L. pulchella; however there is molecular evidence that the two species are not sister taxa, and therefore are treated as distinct species in the Flora of North America. To tell the two species apart, use your hand lens and look at the leaf margins. L. baileyi has minutely ciliate margins and L. pulchella has entire margins. Ethnobotany: Unknown Etymology: Lorandersonia honors Chrysothamnus enthusiast Loran C. Anderson, (1936- ); baileyi honors American botanist William W. Bailey (1843-1914). Editor: AHazelton 2017 ",

Leaves: Mostly basal, some cauline, alternate, pinnately 5-11 foliate, leaflets oblanceolate in outline, 0.8-3 cm long, pinnatifid, cleft about halfway to the midvein, with more-or-less 10 lobes, green and usually strigose above, grayish tomentose beneath, ultimate margins rolled under; stipules with entire to irregularly cleft margins; basal blades long-petiolate, cauline blades short-petiolate. Flowers: Inflorescence an open, branched, leafy cyme; flowers numerous, relatively inconspicuous; hypanthium shallowly cup-shaped, hirsute externally; bractlets broadly lanceolate, 3-7 mm long; sepals broadly lanceolate to deltate, 3.5-8.5 mm long; petals broadly obovoid, 2-4 mm long, yellow; stamens 15-20; pistils numerous, the style 0.7-0.8 mm long; flowers June-August. Fruits: Achene, 1.1-1.4 mm long, yellowish green, slightly wrinkled to smooth.

It occurs in meadows, streambanks, and montane habitats at 2000-2600 m (6500-8500 ft). Potentilla arizonica (Arizona cinquefoil) is very similar to P. plattensis, but is distinguished primarily by its erect or ascending habit; herbage is densely long-villous; leaves are 15-25 foliate; and the pedicels are erect or ascending. Endemic to Arizona, it is scattered sporadically in meadows in ponderosa pine forests between Flagstaff and Williams. The Navajo use the root of P. pensylvanica as a life medicine (cure- all).

Ecology: Found along washes, on gravelly slopes and rocky hillsides from 2,000-5,000 ft (610-1524 m); flowers March-September. Distribution: s UT, s NV, s CA, AZ, w NM; south to nw MEX. Notes: The most suffrutescent of the Psilostrophe in the region, as well as having the most tomentose herbage. Pay attention to the exserted disc flowers to distinguish between Psilostrophe, Zinnia, and Melampodium. Ethnobotany: Unknown, but other species in the genus have many uses. Etymology: Psilostrophe is from Greek psilos, naked or glabrous, and strophe, to turn, while cooperi is named for Dr. James Graham Cooper (1830-1902) an American geologist who collected plants in the Mojave in 1861. Synonyms: Riddellia cooperi Editor: SBuckley, 2010 ",

Presence of Salix amygdaloides in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont has not been verified; its occurrence in those New England states was reported by H. A. Gleason and A. Cronquist (1991), and by M. L. Fernald (1950).Hybrids:Salix amygdaloides forms natural hybrids with S. gooddingii and S. nigra. Hybrids with S. caroliniana (N. M. Glatfelter 1898) and S. eriocephala (M. L. Fernald 1950) have been reported; no convincing specimens have been seen. Controlled pollination between S. amygdaloides and S. eriocephala, S. interior, and S. petiolaris set no seed; controlled pollination with S. lucida produced a few seeds; some seedlings suffered necrosis in the cotyledon stage (A. Mosseler 1990).Salix amygdaloides \u00d7 S. gooddingii (S. \u00d7wrightii Andersson): This hybrid occurs throughout the Rio Grande Valley, Texas, and New Mexico (C. K. Schneider 1919; C. R. Ball 1961), and at Happy and Rio Frio, Texas, and Virgil Run, Arizona. The leaves are somewhat glaucous abaxially, as in S. amygdaloides, but they are linear to narrowly elliptic and branchlets are sparsely pubescent as in S. gooddingii.Salix amygdaloides \u00d7 S. nigra (S. \u00d7glatfelteri C. K. Schneider) resembles S. amygdaloides in leaves somewhat glaucous abaxially, but usually linear or narrowly elliptic, as in S. nigra. The stipules are not as prominent as in S. nigra but are foliaceous on late leaves; it should be expected wherever the ranges of the two species overlap. The hybrid is common in Missouri, where N. M. Glatfelter (1894) estimated that ca. 40% of the populations were hybrids, and in Illinois (R. H. Mohlenbrock 1980; G. Wilhelm, pers. comm.). Putative hybrids occur also in Ontario. Narrow leaves are typical of juvenile plants of S. amygdaloides but even at that stage they tend to be broadest at the midpoint or toward the base rather than in a midzone as in S. nigra. ",

Needles: Scale-like, 1-3 mm long, green to dark green, usually with a resin gland on the back. Cones: Male and female cones on separate plants; pollen (male) cones located at branch tips, about 3 mm long, oblong, yellow-brown; seed (female) cones located at branch tips, 6-8 mm long, spheric to ovoid, fleshy and resinous, green with a waxy bloom when immature, and maturing reddish blue to brownish blue; seed cones maturing the same year they are produced. Seeds: Usually 1 per cone, 4-5 mm long, light brown. Ecology: Found on dry hills, plains, and plateaus, often mixed with ponderosa and pinyon pines and other Juniper species, from 3,000-7,000 ft (914-2134 m); pollen shedding Feb-April. Distribution: AZ, CO, NM, TX Ethnobotany: The berries were eaten raw or ground and baked into bread; dried berries are made into beads for jewelry; leaves were used medicinally; branches burned for purification; leaf ash added to corn to make posole or hominy; and the wood and bark are an important fuel source.

Leaves: Basal and stem leaves mostly withering before flowering; blades linear, 2-6 cm long and 2-8 mm wide, the margins entire, toothed, or irregularly pinnately lobed; upper stem leaves reduced in size. Flowers: Flower heads pinkish, ligulate, solitary at branch tips or in paniculate clusters on glabrous peduncles; involuvres cylindric-conical, 6-10 mm high, subtended by calyculi of 3-7 bractlets; phyllaries 5-8 in 2 equal series, linear-lanceolate, and green or purple; florets all ligulate (like ray florets but always bisexual), 3-5 per flower head, the ligules (ray petals) 7-10 mm long, flesh-colored. Fruits: Achenes 3-5 mm long, longitudinally striate and often transversely rugulose; topped with a pappus of brown-tinged plumose bristles, 5-7 mm long. Ecology: Found along washes, on gravelly bajadas, plains, and arid mesas, below 7,000 ft (2134 m); flowers April-October. Distribution: CA, NV, UT, AZ, CO, NM, WY, TX, KA, OK; south to s MEX. Notes: A perennial with wiry stems and a slightly woody base; the basal leaves are pinnately lobed and stem leaves are bractlike; leaves have tufts of hair at the base; all leaves may be gone by flowering time; flower heads have 4-6 pinkish florets; and the seeds have tan-brown tuft of bristles which is plumose on the upper 80%. Similar to S. tenuifolia but that species is less woody at the base; has glands on the peduncles; and the achenes have a pappus of white bristles which are plumose from the base to the top. Ethnobotany: Used to increase mother's milk supply; as a narcotic; and chewed as gum; also used ceremonially. Etymology: Stephanomeria is derived from Greek stephane, wreath or crown, and meros, division, referring to the pappus on the achenes; pauciflora means with little foliage.

Stems 1-5+, divaricately and intricately branched (often forming dense bushes), usually glabrous, rarely tomentose. Leaves withered at flowering; basal blades linear-lanceolate, runcinate, 3-7 cm, margins pinnately lobed (faces glabrous); cauline much reduced and bractlike. Heads borne singly along branches.  Peduncles 3-10 mm.  Calyculi of appressed bractlets. Involucres 8-11 mm (phyllaries 4-6, glabrous). Florets 5-6.

Flowering May-Sep. Sandy, gravelly washes and slopes in desert shrub communities, juniper woodlands, open, sandy short-grass plains; 200-1500 m; Ariz., Calif., Colo., Kans., Nev., N.Mex., Okla., Tex., Utah, Wyo.; Mexico (Chihuahua, Sonora). Stephanomeria pauciflora generally grows as an intricately branched, often rounded bush. Occasional plants, usually from Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and southern Utah, have long, flexuous stems and branches, an architecture that resembles one of the typical forms of S. tenuifolia. Some plants of S. pauciflora have white pappi, also typical of S. tenuifolia. It is not known if these plants represent uncommon and unusual individuals or if they are from populations in which all plants have those traits. It is also not known whether such plants of S. pauciflora grow near populations of S. tenuifolia; if so, they may result from interspecific hybridization. That is a possibility; experimental hybrid plants produced by crossing individuals from the two species were about 20% fertile. Such fertility suggests the species are sufficiently compatible that fully fertile segregants with variously intermediate morphologies could be expected where they hybridize in nature. The experimental crosses were made reciprocally between S. pauciflora from Riverside County, California (L. D. Gottlieb 6653), and S. tenuifolia from Wheeler County, Oregon (L. D. Gottlieb 6692); specimens of the six F1 hybrid plants that were produced are deposited at DAV. Plants of S. pauciflora that are densely tomentose throughout are occasionally found, particularly in the deserts of California and Nevada, and have been named S. cinerea or S. pauciflora var. parishii.

Leaves: Subopposite to irregularly alternate; subsessile on 1-3 mm petioles; blades erect, ovate to mostly lanceolate or oblong-linear, becoming more or less narrower upwards, 1-6 cm long, 5-25 mm wide, tips long-attenuate and acute to obtuse, bases acute to obtuse or rounded, margins short-woolly, upper surfaces glabrous or nearly so, and lower surfaces glabrate, pubescent, or sparsely short woolly. Flowers: Small, yellowish, in large showy umbels, these solitary, sessile, terminal on the longer branches, and subtended by 1-4 leaflike bracts, these 2-5 cm wide; corollas greenish to purplish, the lobes 4-6 mm long; hoods mostly white to yellow, quite variable in form, erect-ascending to divergent, narrowly to very broadly obovoid, widening upward to a truncate or oblique rim, mostly broader than long, 2-4 mm long along the dorsal surface, 1-4 mm broad across the top, as long as to ca. 1 mm longer than the gynostegium; the horns attached near the middle of the hoods, radially flat, incurved, exserted 0.5-2 mm; calyx lobes to 3 mm long. Fruits: Follicles erect on deflexed to spreading pedicels, 3.5-6 cm long. Ecology: Found in sandy desert scrub, chaparral, grasslands, dry plains, mesas, and oak-pine woodlands, on flats and in arroyos from 3,500-7,000 ft (1067-2134 m); flowers April-July. Distribution: AZ and UT, east through CO and NM to KS, OK, TX. Notes: This small, low-growing milkweed is distinguished by its white-yellowish flowers and the white-hairy margins of the long-triangular leaves. Has a similar semi-trailing growth form as A. brachystephana, but that species has purplish flowers and narrower, blue-tinged leaves that lack the distinct white-hairy margins of A. involucrata. Also strongly resembles the A. uncialis complex (including A. ruthiae, A. sanjuanensis) but those species have dark purple flowers. The species is said to be favored by jackrabbits.  Some treatments, notably Welsh et al-s Utah Flora and Allred et al-s Flora Neomexicana consider A. macrosperma to be a separate species with wider leaves and more pubescent all over, but this guide follows Sundell et al-s treatment for Arizona in including A. macrosperma within A. involucrata. Ethnobotany: Infusion of plant used as a stomach medicine; poultice of heated roots applied for toothaches; dry powdered root mixed with saliva and used for unspecified illness. Etymology: Asclepias is named for the Greek God of healing Asklepios, and involucrata means provided with an involucre, referring to the leafy bracts that subtend the flower clusters.

Leaves: Pinnately compound leaves, leaflets 9-19, opposite, elliptic to oblanceolate, to 7 mm long, the uppermost surface glabrous to strigose, strigose beneath. Flowers: Inflorescences borne on peduncles 2-9 cm long, racemes with up to 20 flowers, flowers 7-11.5 mm long, ascending and cream, green, pink, or purple in color, often with purple veins, the calyx campanulate, strigose, with teeth to 5 mm long, the keel with a conspicuous, beak-like projection at right angles to the claw. Fruits: Pods ascending, ovoid or oblong-ellipsoid, to 14 mm long and 6 mm wide, strigose, unilocular, floral remnant sometimes persistent. Ecology: Found in mountain brush, shrublands, aspen, pi-on, juniper, and ponderosa pine communities, from 5,500-9,000 ft (1676-2743 m). Notes: These prostrate forbs are recognizable by their greenish-cream colored flowers with purplish venation. Another good key (if you have a good hand lens or scope) is that the hairs on the vegetation are dolabriform, meaning that they are axe-shaped or cleaver-shaped and they usually attach near the middle. Ethnobotany: The leaves or whole plants was used as a life medicine, the leaves were dried and powdered and applied to sores, and the plant was used as a ceremonial chant lotion. Synonyms: Many, see Tropicos Editor: LCrumbacher, 2011 Etymology: Astragalus comes from the Greek astragalos meaning \"ankle bone\" and an early name applied to some plants in this family because of the shape of the seeds, while humistratus means low layer, in reference to an often low-growing habit.

Leaves: Opposite along the stems, the lower leaves on petioles about half as long as the leaf blade, and upper leaves subsessile; blades ovate to lanceolate, 1-5 cm long, with a pointed tip and a smooth or slightly wavy margin; leaf surfaces puberulent or short-villous, and often glandular.

Ecology: Found on sandy soil, plains, washes, arroyos, and disturbed habitats, from 1,500-4,500 ft (457-1372 m); flowers September-October. Distribution: AZ, NM, and TX; south to MEX Notes: Widespread and distinguished by its narrowly obovoid fruit, along with its 1-2 mm-long flowers. Distinguished from several other Boerhavia spp by its flowers being arranged in spikes or racemes at branch tips, whereas other species have more or less umbel-like clusters of flowers at branch tips. B. torreyana and B. coulteri also have flowers arranged in spikes, but those species have stems that can be somewhat hairy near the base of plant, and do not have glandular hairs as in B. spicata. Some authors have lumped this taxon with B. torreyana and B. coulteri, but FNA (2004) and Allred (2012) recognize both of those as separate species. Ethnobotany: The Mayo of northern Mexico used the leaves to make a tea to treat measles. Etymology: Boerhavia named for Dutch botanist Hermann Boerhaave (1663-1738); spicata refers to the spicate flowers. Synonyms: Boerhavia watsonii Editor: SBuckley 2010, AHazelton 2017 ",

Vegetative: Leaves all clustered near the base, generally shorter than stems, slender, flat 1-3 mm wide, papillose above, sheaths tight, green with hyaline fronts, ligules less than 2 mm. Inflorescence: Bracts subtending the spikes short, inconspicuous and sheathless, less than 1 cm, 5-10 crowded spikes above, 0.5-3 cm long by 5-8 mm wide, spikes with 2-10 ascending perigynia, androgynous; pistillate scales hyaline to pale brown or green with 1-3 veined center, ovate, 2.5-3.2 mm long by 1.5-2.5 mm wide, body shorter than length of perigynia, apex acute to short awned; perigynia brown, face 7-15 mm below, otherwise veinless, 3-4 mm long by about 2 mm long, base of perigynium spongy, thickened and longitudinally striate above, margins serrulate with beak 0.5-1 mm; achenes ovate to circular, 1.5-2.5 mm long by 1.5-2 mm wide.  Ecology: Found on moist to moderately dry slopes from 7,000-9,500 ft (2134-2896 m); flowers April-August. Notes: In our region there are two varieties: var. vallicola and var. rusbyi. These have never been documented in SODN parks but are both within the realm of possibility.  Of the two, var. rusbyi is more likely to be found. This is a cespitose sedge most similar to Carex occidentalis. In Carex occidentalis, the pistillate scales cover the body of the perigynia, while in C. vallicola they are shorter, exposing more of the perigynia. The perigynia in Carex vallicola are plumper and more distended by the achene, such that in many cases the marginal nerves have been pushed slightly onto the ventral surface, while in C. occidentalis the marginal nerves stay at the margin of the plano-convex perigynia. In Carex vallicola, the perigynia spread more irregularly in each spike, giving the inflorescence a less smooth overall feel than in C. occidentalis.  (Notes: Max Licher and Glenn Rink 2012) Ethnobotany: Unknown Etymology: Carex is the classical Latin name for the genus, while vallicola comes from Latin vallis for valley and the ending -cola for dwelling in or inhabiting.

Leaves: Alternate, deeply pinnatifid, the lobes armed with short slender spines, the upper surface green and only sparsely tomentose, the underside densely tomentose. Flowers: Heads discoid, disks pink, lavender, or white, involucres broad, phyllaries in 6-9 series, the outer phyllaries broad, lance-ovate to ovate, with short, slender spines more than 2 mm long, the inner ones purple-tipped and unarmed, erose, dilated and twisted, receptacles densely bristly, the heads usually borne solitary at the branch tips. Fruits: Achenes with brownish streaks, 6-7 mm. Pappus 15-20 mm long. Ecology: Found in coniferous, pine-oak, and open pine forest, and juniper-dominated woodlands, from 5,000-9,000 ft (1524-2743 m); flowering June-October. Distribution: Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah; Mexico. Notes: The keys to this species are the purple or lavender corollas, the heads solitary at the branch and stem tips, the phyllaries broad, lance-ovate or ovate, the inner ones dilated and twisted, with erose tips, the prickles more than 2 mm long. Ethnobotany: Unknown Etymology: Cirsium is Greek for thistle, while wheeleri is named for George Wheeler (1842-1905) who mapped the Great Basin and Mojave deserts.

Leaves: Basal, forming a rosette, linear to narrowly oblanceolate, 4.5-15 cm long (including petiole), glabrous, margins entire to somewhat wavy, base gradually tapering to petiole, apex obtuse to rounded; petiole winged. Flowers: Inflorescence an umbel, 3-25 flowered; involucral bracts narrowly lanceolate to linear; pedicels slender, 0.4-7 cm long, the central ones usually the longest; calyx top- shaped, 3.3-5 mm long, lobes 5, spreading, triangular, 1- 1.6 (2) mm long, shorter than the tube, greenish to red- tinged; corolla minute, the tube as long as the lobes, these 1.2-1.5 mm long, white; flowers April-September. Fruits: Capsule, oblong-ovoid, 6-11 mm long, 5-valved at apex; seeds numerous, minute. Ecology: Mountain meadows, alpine to subalpine habitats, mixed conifer forests; 2000-3000 m (6500-10000 ft); Apache, Coconino, Greenlee, and Navajo counties; western to southwestern U.S. Notes: Dodecatheon dentatum (Wasatch shooting star) [=D. ellisiae] is distinguished by ovate leaves, the base rounded to cordate, abruptly contracting to the petiole; it has 5 corolla and calyx lobes, the corolla lobes white. It occurs along streambanks, in moist shaded habitats, and on rock outcrops in eastern Arizona. Dodecatheon pulchellum (dark-throat shooting star) also has 5-parted flowers, a somewhat shorter calyx (3.5-7 mm long), and stamens with connate filaments, exposed beyond the corolla for 1.8-3.6 mm. Its leaves taper to the petioles and the blades are mostly spatulate to oblanceolate or elliptic. Alpine shooting star is a host plant for the arctic blue butterfly. Editor: Springer et al. 2008 ",

Capsules tan to light brown, often purplish toward apex, valvate, narrowly ovoid, 5-11(-12) \u00d7 3-7 mm, glabrous; walls thin, pliable. Seeds with membrane along edges. 2n = 44. Flowering late spring-summer. Moist to boggy meadows and stream banks, mainly in montane conifer woodlands; 1900-3500 m; Ariz., Calif., Nev., Oreg., Utah, Wash. Dodecatheon alpinum is found in widely scattered locations in the San Jacinto Mountains, Transverse Ranges, Sierra Nevada, northern coastal ranges, and the Siskiyou Mountains of California, southwestern Oregon, and west-central Nevada, and in the Cascade Ranges to just north of the Columbia River in Skamania and Yakima counties of Washington. It may be seen on scattered basin ranges in the Intermountain West of Nevada (e.g., East Humboldt, Jarbidge, Ruby, Snake) and western Utah (Deep Creek Mountains), and in some desert ranges of southern Oregon as far east as the Steens Mountains in Harney County; it is disjunct to the Blue and Wallowa mountains of northeastern Oregon. There are other disjunct populations in the northern Wasatch and Uinta mountains of northern and northeastern Utah, and even more widely scattered populations in the southern Wasatch and Tushar mountains. The species has also been found at Warm Springs in Millard County. Isolated populations occur on the Pine Valley Mountains, Utah, and around the Grand Canyon and Mogollon Rim areas of Arizona as far south as Greenlee County. Narrow-leaved plants that are sparsely glandular-pubescent are sometimes found at higher elevations in the Sierra Nevada, making a distinction between Dodecatheon alpinum and D. jeffreyi occasionally arbitrary. A specimen from Deschutes County, Oregon (C. L. Hitchcock and J. S. Martin 4919, UTC, WTU) has leaf blades to 3.5 cm wide. ",

The name Eleocharis montana was long misapplied to E. montevidensis.  The type of E. palmeri, recognized as a species (H. K. Svenson 1957), is indistinguishable from specimens of E. montevidensis.  Eleocharis montevidensis is extremely variable; the broadly rounded, usually wrinkled and recurved floral scales are diagnostic.  Achenes often fail to form.  Eleocharis montevidensis is apparently closely related to E. parishii, in which the floral scales are less densely placed on the rachilla and acute to rounded, and the spikelets are narrowly lanceoloid to cylindric.

Achenes light brown to brown, 2-5 mm, glabrous. As Eriogonum heermannii is here circumscribed, the number of varieties is dramatically decreased from past presentations, with E. apachense reduced to synonymy under a now greatly expanded var. argense. Also included in that variety is the more stoutly branched var. subracemosum. The southern var. heermannii of basically desert ranges and the more northern var. occidentale of the Coast Ranges in California are maintained, but their separation is more traditional than certain. The fragile and bulky nature of many dried, often poorly prepared specimens, and the tendency for leaves to fall away have made varietal identification within E. heermannii difficult.Eriogonum heermannii varieties are food plants for Ellis's dotted-blue butterfly (Euphilotes ellisi) and the Mormon metalmark (Apodemia mormo mormo).

Leaves: Thin or thick, on petioles 0.5-1.5 cm long, blades elliptic or oblong to obovate, 4.5-14 cm long, 2-9 cm wide, green and pubescent on both sides, margins generally serrate.  Flowers: Axillary cyme of 2-20 flowers, with hemispheric hypanthium, 5 sepals and petals, triangular sepals 1-2 mm long, petals light yellow, about 1 mm long with 3 lobed stigma. Fruits: Spherical drupes, purplish black when ripe, 0.5-1 cm wide with 3 small seeds.  Ecology: Found on stream or creek banks from 4,500-9,000 ft (1372-2743 m); flowers April-September. Notes: Ours is of ssp. betulifolia which is distinguished by the thin, oblong to elliptic leaves with thin veins. Ssp. obovata is distinguished by having thick obovate leaves with thick, prominent veins and is typically found in the northern part of Arizona. Ethnobotany: Used as a ceremonial emetic. Etymology: Frangula is thought to mean fragile, referring to the brittle twigs of alder, while betulifolia means with leaves like beech, or of the genus Betula.

Leaves: Sessile and mostly clustered near the base of the stem; blades fleshy and terete (round in cross section), up to 5 cm long and 2 mm wide. Flowers: Pale pink to purple, arranged in few-flowered clusters or cymes which are held well above the leaves on a slender leafless stalk up to 15 cm tall; sepals 2 per flower, ovate, 3-4 mm long, and usually deciduous before the seed capsules mature; petals 5 per flower, obovate to elliptic, 5-7 mm long, usually light pink to purplish, but flower color can range from white to magenta. Fruits: Capsules 3-5 mm long, ellipsoid or ovoid, 3-chambered; splitting open longitudinally from the apex to release many tiny seeds, each about 1 mm long. Ecology: Found in shrublands, woodlands, and chaparral, on outcrops or in rocky soil, from 4,000-8,000 ft (1219-2438 m); flowers June-September. Distribution: WY to MN, south to AZ, NM, TX, LA, and AL; south to n MEX. Notes: This small perennial is distinctive with its basal tuft of succulent, terete leaves, and delicate pink flowers held above the leaves on a slender scape. The flowers are only open for a few hours in the afternoon. The species has a fairly large range across central and western North America and is somewhat variable across its range, especially in plant height, sepal shape, and pedicel length. FNA (2003) lumps P. confertiflorus into P. parviflorus, and the above description follows that treatment. Allred and Ivey (2012) and Bair et al. (2006; Vascular Plants of Arizona Project) also follow FNA, but Heil et al. (2013) consider P. confertfilorus to be a separate taxon, with sepals that persist on the plant as the seed pods mature and split open, and narrower seed pods. This taxon can be challenging to locate in older texts; the genus Phemeranthus was recently split out from the tropical genus Talinum, and both these genera were formerly placed in Portulacaceae. Ethnobotany: A poultice of the root bark was applied to sores; an infusion of the root bark was used as lotion. Etymology: Phemeranthus comes from Greek ephemoros, living for one day, and anthos, flower; parviflorus means small-flowered. Synonyms: Talinum parviflorum, Talinum gooddingii, Talinum confertiflorum, Tallinum appalachianum, Talinum fallax, Talinum gracile, Talinum rosei Editor: SBuckley 2010, AHazelton 2017 ",

Leaves sessile; blade terete, sometimes slightly broadened at base, to 5 cm. Inflorescences cymose, much overtopping leaves; peduncle scapelike, to 15 cm. Flowers usually pedicellate, sometimes sessile or subsessile; sepals deciduous or sometimes persistent, ovate, to 4.5 mm, apex sometimes purplish, acuminate-cornate, thickened; petals light pink to purplish, elliptic to obovate, to 7 mm; stamens (4-)5(-6); stigma 1, subcapitate, sometimes stigmas 3-lobed, or 3, triangular. Capsules ellipsoid or sometimes ovoid, sometimes obtusely trigonous, 3-5 mm. Seeds without arcuate ridges, 0.8-1 mm. 2n = 24, 48. Flowering Apr-Sep. Dry woodland, grassland, chaparral, scrub, canyon washes, mountain slopes and ledges, sandy, usually rocky soil, outcrops; 0-2700 m; Ala., Ariz., Ark., Colo., Ill., Iowa, Kans., La., Minn., Mo., Nebr., N.Mex., N.Dak., Okla., S.Dak., Tex., Utah, Wyo.; n Mexico (Chihuahua, Coahuila). Over its extensive range, Phemeranthus parviflorus varies considerably in several characters, including overall size. Although this variation is more or less continuous, correlating very generally with habitat type and geographic location, some populations that are found toward the limits of the species\u00b4 range and that exhibit combinations of tendencies to extremes in the variable characters have been recognized separately. The Alabama populations, few and confined to a very small area on gneiss in the central part of the state, disjunct from the main trans-Mississippi distribution of P. parviflorus, with elongate stems, small flowers, and stigmas often three-lobed, or three instead of one, have been described as Talinum appalachianum. Plants from Arizona with stems slender and tending to elongate, sepals acuminate-cornate and usually purplish, and capsules ovoid have been described as T. gooddingii. Plants from the mountains of New Mexico with elongate stems, subsessile flowers, markedly congested cymes, and acuminate, often persistent sepals have been described as T. confertiflorum (P. confertiflorus).

Leaves: Mostly alternate along the stems, with the leaves near the base sometimes in whorls; blades linear, 8-25 mm long and 1-2 mm wide; the whorls of leaves near bottom of stems are wider and early-deciduous. Flowers: White to lavender, in dense, spikelike racemes at the tops of the stems; sepals 5 per flower, the 3 outer sepals greenish to purplish and the inner 2 sepals much larger, white, and appearing petal-like; petals 3 per flower, the lowest petal keel-shaped, with an often purplish fringed crest, the other 2 petals (wings) white with a green center and fused to the stamen tube. Fruits: Capsule elliptic, 3 mm long, slightly flattened; splitting open longitudinally to release 2 seeds. Ecology: Found on dry plains and hills, from 5,000-7,500 ft (1524-2286 m); flowers May-September. Distribution: AZ, east to TX and north to ND, MT, and CAN; south to n MEX. Notes: Distinct with its cluster of few to many delicate slender, hairless stems from a branched base, making the plant's appearence anywhere from sparse-stemmed to broom-like; the leaves are linear to scale-like and alternate along the stems, with a few whorls of wider, early-deciduous leaves near the base of each stem; the upper few inches of each stem is lined with green- and purple-tinged white flowers. The flower buds are strongly purple-tinged, but the flowers appear much more white once they are open and mature. Flowers are followed by rounded to oval-shaped seed pods. P. scoparioides is similar but has pubescent stems; lacks the whorls of leaves near the bottom of the stems; and has winged seed pods. Ethnobotany: The Sioux made a decoction of the root to treat ear aches.

Early-season plants of Anemone multifida var. multifida have solitary flowers and will key to var. saxicola . Anemone multifida var. tetonensis and especially var. saxicola might be based on characteristics that are influenced primarily by environment; further study is warranted.Native Americans used Anemone multifida (no varieties specified) medicinally as an antirheumatic, cold remedy, nosebleed cure, and general panacea, as well as a means of killing lice and fleas (D. E. Moerman 1986). ",

Leaves: Opposite, on petioles 4-12 mm long; blades deltoid to rhombic-ovate, 1-6 cm long by 1-3 cm wide, 3-nerved from base, margins with 1-3 sets of sharp teeth, usually near the base, the bases truncate, hastate, or subcordate, the apices actute, and the faces sparsely puberulent. Flowers: Flower heads discoid, arranged in loose panicles, the peduncles 5-40 mm long, pubesent and sometimes gland-dotted; involucre (ring of bracts wrapped around the flower head) cylindric to campanulate 8-12 mm, the bracts (phyllaries) 17-22 in 4-6 series, narrowly lanceolate to linear, 4-5 striate, unequal, greenish, often purple-tinged, with scarious margins; florets 13-25, all discs, the corollas 8 mm long, yellow-green or purple tinged. Fruits: Achenes 3-5 mm, hispidulous, yellow-brown to yellow-gray, topped with a pappus of 28-40 smooth to barbellulate bristles. Ecology: Found on arid and rocky slopes, from 2,000-4,000 ft (610-1219 m); flowers September-May. Distribution: AZ, s NM, sw TX; south to c MEX. Notes: Brickellia is a genus of shrubs and perennial herbs with all disc flowers, these usually white to cream colored; flower heads wrapped in several rows of bracts (phyllaries), the outer rows shorter than the inner rows; and 10-nerved seeds topped with white tufts of bristles. B. coulteri is a fragrant shrub, very brittle in appearance, with somewhat more delicate branches and inflorescences than other shrubby Brickellias; the leaves are small, usually less than 4 cm long, opposite, and triangular-ovate with 1-3 pairs of enlarged, sharp teeth at the base; flower heads are clustered or solitary, on short peduncles less than 4 cm long. B. atractyloides also has leaves with sharply toothed edges, but in that species the leaves are usually alternate and the teeth are not concentrated near the bottom of the leaves. Ethnobotany: Unknown, but other species in this genus have uses. Etymology: Brickellia is named for Dr. John Brickell (1749-1809), a botanist and physician who worked in Georgia; coulteri is named for Dr. Thomas Coulter (1793-1843), the first botanist to collect in Arizona.

Fruits bright red or orange red, 15-25 mm, pulp white (or pale pink). 2n = 22. Flowering Mar-May; fruiting 2 months after flowering. Sonoran Desert upland, interior chaparral, desert grasslands, pinyon-juniper woodlands; 700-2000 m; Ariz. Plants in most populations of Echinocereus bonkerae have radial spines almost pectinately arranged and central spines very short or absent, creating the superficial appearance of E. dasyacanthus, E. pectinatus, or similar species. Formerly, all short-spined plants in central and southern Arizona were treated as E. bonkerae, including unusually short-spined individuals of E. fendleri and E. fasciculatus. Today we recognize that E. bonkerae, E. fendleri, and E. fasciculatus all vary from short-spined to long-spined. Populations at the lowest altitude for the species have taller stems and unusually long, slender central spines (to 10 cm); they have recently been named Echinocereus apachensis. Such plants were part of the basis for L. D. Benson\u00b4s polyphyletic concept (1969, 1982) of E. fasciculatus var. boyce-thompsonii (see 8. E. fasciculatus).Echinocereus bonkerae is a poorly defined species, frequently lumped with E. fendleri or E. fasciculatus, and it is not always identifiable in the field. Although rib number, blooming season, habitat preference, and, in particular regions, spine length or central spine presence are helpful characteristics, ploidy level is the most objective criterion for distinguishing E. bonkerae from E. fasciculatus. Immature plants of E. bonkerae are like E. fasciculatus and unlike the immature plants of E. fendleri, which are tuberculate with their spines long, few, soft, and often curved or twisted. ",

            "desc_field_guide": "General: Perennial, 15-40 cm tall; stems erect, nearly scapose; herbage pilose-hirsute throughout; caudex thick, scaly, branched, forming matted clumps. Leaves: Basal and cauline (1 pair, opposite), blades oblanceolate in outline, pinnately lobed, becoming somewhat pinnatifid above, leaflets 9-19, 13-22 mm long, deeply cleft into linear segments, ultimate margins toothed, cauline blades much reduced, borne along the middle of the stem; stipules leaf-like, margins entire to toothed; basal blades long-petiolate, cauline blades shortly petiolate. Flowers: Inflorescence a cyme, 4-9 flowered, the flowers more-or- less erect, borne on long pedicels; hypanthium more-or- less discoid; sepals reflexed at time of flowering, 2.8-6 mm long, finely and minutely tomentose within; petals spreading, obovate, 3.5-6.5 mm long, yellow; stamens numerous; flowers July-September. Fruits: Achene, numerous, pear-shaped, about 3 mm long; style jointed, the persistent lower portion 2-4 mm long, feathery, the deciduous upper portion 3.5-5.5 mm long, pale, hispid at the base. Ecology: Streambanks, meadows, pine forests, slopes, montane habitats; 1800-3000 m (6000-10000 ft); Apache, Coconino, Gila, Greenlee, and Navajo counties; central and western Canada, north-central, western, and southwestern U.S. Notes: Ours, as here described, is var. ciliatum. Geum rossii (Ross-s avens) is differentiated by glabrous or pubescent herbage; flowering stems bear numerous alternate leaves; flowers are erect; petals are 5-9 mm long, yellow; and the style is glabrous throughout, not greatly elongating in fruit. It occurs in subalpine to alpine meadows and on scree slopes; in our area found on the San Francisco Peaks. Ours is var. turbinatum [=G. turbinatum]. Geum triflorum is a highly drought-tolerant species with moderate shade and fire tolerance, and it can be propagated via seed and exposed root transplants. The plant has many medicinal uses, most commonly to treat pain and stiffness. Its feathery pinkish achenes make it a delightful addition to the rock garden. Editor: Springer et al. 2008 ",

            "desc_field_guide": "Martin and Hutchins 1980, Anderson et al. 2007Duration: Perennial Nativity: Native Lifeform: Forb/Herb General: Perennial, erect to 50 cm tall, with puberulous herbage. Leaves: Opposite, narrowly linear to narrowly lanceolate, often folded at the midrib (conduplicate), apiculate, 3-6 mm wide. Flowers: Narrow inflorescence with few flowers, densely glandular-pubescent, calyx 5-6 mm long, lobes ovate to elliptic, sometimes narrowly scarious margined at the base; corolla red, 25-30 mm long, throat gradually and moderately expanded, lower lobes glabrous; staminode included. Fruits: Septicidal capsule. Ecology: Found in foothills of desert scrub, desert grasslands, chaparral, and the lower range of pi-on-juniper-oak woodlands from 5,000-6,000 ft (1524-1829 m); flowers June-August. Notes: There appears to be lingering questions as to whether this species is indeed a separate species, P. ramosus. If it is separate as it was treated in 1966 by Crosswhite, then it is a narrow endemic species native to southeastern Arizona and New Mexico. Anderson et al. 2007 argue that it is not a distinct population, but instead found many species across its range back into Mexico. ITIS and Plants DB have not caught up with this information, they still refer to this species as P. ramosus. Ethnobotany: Unknown, but other species in the genera have uses. Etymology: Penstemon is from Greek pente, five and stemon, indicating the five stamens of the genus, while lanceolatus means lance shaped. Synonyms: Penstemon ramosus, Penstemon pauciflorus Editor: SBuckley, 2010 ",
